# Example2_2d_engine
example code pieces towards building a 2d engine

this is not a complete project.  to use these files, merge them in with your main project folder including your implementation of the queue in jobs/

You may also want to just use these as reference points to develop your own 2d sprite implementations. 

this code depends on SDL and SDL_Image.
